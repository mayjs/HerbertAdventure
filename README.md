HerbertAdventure
================

An adventure game about Herbert developed by a team of 7 Students in 4 days during the SMIMS (http://www.smims.nrw.de/).

The first version of the game was developed using Swing for the GUI, and was a kind of a quick 'n dirty-solution so there is a playable game for the closing presentation. One might even see it as an engine for adventure games while the whole story is located in the xml-Files delivered with the project.

Currently, we are working on cleaning up the code, changing the whole model and using Slick2D (http://slick.ninjacave.com/) for graphics. Stay tuned for updates!

The old version is still located in the de.nrw.smims2013.adventure.\* packages, while the recent version is located in de.herbert.\*. If you want to take a look, just run de.nrw.smims2013.adventure.main.Main and enjoy.
