HerbertAdventure
================

An adventure game about Herbert developed by a team of 7 Students in 4 days during the SMIMS (http://www.smims.nrw.de/).

The first version of the game was developed using Swing for the GUI, and was a kind of a quick 'n dirty-solution so there is a playable game for the closing presentation.

Currently, we are working on cleaning up the code, changing the whole model and using Slick2D (http://slick.ninjacave.com/) for graphics.

The old version is still located in the de.nrw.smims2013.adventure.* packages, while the recent version is located in de.herbert.*.
